# SpanishX

This is the server repo for SpanishX, a spaced repetition learning app for the Spanish language.

### Techonologies
The server side of this project uses
 * Node with Express to handle routing
 * A MongoDB database hosted on mLab, with Mongoose for schema design and communicating with MongoDB
 * Passport with JWT to handle user authentication
